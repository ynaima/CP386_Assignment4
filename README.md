Assignment 4 for cp386
This project focuses on the concept of deadlock avoidance and aontiguous memory allocation.
The program in this project will be able to manage a contiguous region of memory, by allocating memory spaces to processes based on the the amount of memory they need and the specific algorithm.
The program will allocate memory using the first fit(F), best fit(B), and worst fit(W) algorithms.
The program will be able to respond to commands like 'Status' for reporting status of the memory, 'RL' for releasing memory, 'RQ' for requesting memory.
The program is invoked as : ./allocation <amount of memory>

The program is run using the make file, using the command 'make run filename'

The program will include one source code file 'allocation.c'
Each partner worked on one algorithm.
The program will be tested with various processes requesting for release of memory or allocation of memory.
The program will have the an output similar to the one provided in the question.
